# LIB-libcrypto
Several routines from openssl, used for shareware code validation, secure authentication, password encryption. Shareware validation is no longer relevant, secure authentication (PKFA) isn't implemented in any FTP server software, so only password encryption is really useful. Uses homebrewn build system (Makefiles).
